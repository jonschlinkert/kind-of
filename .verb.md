## Benchmarks

Benchmarked against [typeof](http://github.com/CodingFu/typeof) and [type-of](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/type-of).

```bash

```

## Optimizations

In 7 out of 8 cases, this library is 2x-10x faster than other top libraries included in the benchmarks. There are a few things that lead to this performance advantage, none of them hard and fast rules, but all of them simple and repeatable in almost any code library:

1. Optimize around the fastest and most common use cases first. Of course, this will change from project-to-project, but I took some time to understand how and why `typeof` checks were being used in my own libraries and other libraries I use a lot.
1. Optimize around bottlenecks - In other words, the order in which conditionals are implemented is significant, because each check is only as fast as the failing checks that came before it. Here, the biggest bottleneck by far is checking for plain objects (an object that was created by the `Object` constructor). I opted to make this check happen by process of elimination rather than brute force up front (e.g. by using something like `val.constructor.name`), so that every other type check would not be penalized it.
1. Don't do uneccessary processing - why do `.slice(8, -1).toLowerCase();` just to get the word `regex`? It's much faster to do `if (type === '[object RegExp]') return 'regex'`
1. There is no reason to make the code in a microlib as terse as possible, just to win points for making it shorter. It's always better to favor performant code over terse code. You will always only be using a single `require()` statement to use the library anyway, regardless of how the code is written.


## Better type checking

kind-of seems to be more consistently "correct" than other type checking libs I've looked at. For example, here are some differing results from other popular libs:

### [typeof][] lib

Incorrectly identifies instances of custom constructors (pretty common):

```js
var typeOf = require('typeof');
function Test() {}
console.log(typeOf(new Test()));
//=> 'test'
```

Returns `object` instead of `arguments`:

```js
function foo() {
  console.log(typeOf(arguments)) //=> 'object'
}
foo();
```

### [type-of][] lib

Incorrectly returns `object` for generator functions, buffers, `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`:

```js
function * foo() {}
console.log(typeOf(foo));
//=> 'object'
console.log(typeOf(new Buffer('')));
//=> 'object'
console.log(typeOf(new Map()));
//=> 'object'
console.log(typeOf(new Set()));
//=> 'object'
console.log(typeOf(new WeakMap()));
//=> 'object'
console.log(typeOf(new WeakSet()));
//=> 'object'
```

## TypeScript support

All types resolve correctly with 2 exceptions where typescript cannot yet determine types:

**Iterators**
```typescript
// For Array, Map, String, and Set iterators the return type will be "stringiterator" | "setiterator" | "arrayiterator" | "mapiterator"
kindOf(""[Symbol.iterator]()); // "stringiterator" | "setiterator" | "arrayiterator" | "mapiterator"
```

**Object.create(...)**
```typescript
// You will need to type Object.create(...) yourself as TypeScript types this as any
kindOf(Object.create(null)); // "object"
kindOf(Object.create(null) as object); // "object"
```
